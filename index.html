                <p>My name is Chase Jenkins and I'm from DeWitt, AR. I'm 27 years old and I graduated from the University of Central Arkansas with a Bachelors of Science in Health Sciences and from Arkansas Tech University with a Masters of Science in Health Informatics. I currently work at Southern Methodist University as an Information Systems Specialist where I support a couple software systems as well as assisting my coworkers with any IT related issues. I've been living in Dallas since November 2016 and I love it! I have a 4 year old Siberian Husky named; Hensley. My favorite food is macaroni and cheese and one of my favorite things to do is go to the movies and relax. I hope that one day I become a Full Stack Developer where I can show my passion for solving interesting problems and transforming complication into simplicity.</p>
